This project uses a ResNet18 model in order to predict whether a given MRI image shows the patient has a Brain Tumor or not. There are four classes in the dataset, including glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary. I found the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset">dataset</a> on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">the Kaggle</a> website. <br />
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.9991 on the training and 0.9908 on the validation set. It also gained an 0.9877 accuracy on the test set.
You are also able to run the notebook in Colab with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GGZXqs6oQJcpbJ2GaHnuI5sDDnj5J2pA?usp=sharing">this link</a>.
